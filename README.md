# Akka Streams STOMP connector

**Still WIP**


Allows you to stream messages from a queue server supporting STOMP.
This library is a *very* minimal implementation of *some* of the STOMP protocol but is sufficient when
you want to treat your STOMP queue like a stream (i.e. you don't need to acknowledge messages)
